Repo of our contribution to the Coding da Vinci Hackathon BW 2022. (https://codingdavinci.de)

### Data:
The image selection contains around 230 works of art from the collection of the Staatsgalerie Stauttgart: it´s a colorful mix, comes from different eras and includes diverse painting techniques. Atmospheric landscape painting and city views and still lifes belong to it, as well as abstract painting, organic and floral patterns, striking woodcuts and imaginative prints or constructively suggestive drawings.
What all these works of art have in common are either their special color compositions or their unusual patterns, which sometimes reveal themselves at first glance, sometimes at second.

### Project:
The impulse from the data provider inspired us to create a Smart Mirror which allows you to experience the style of the artwork with the help of AI- generated textures on the 3D T-Shirt model on your reflection.
The software is written in Python and contains several parts:

gui/ :graphical user interface of the whole application, written in PyQt
graphics/ :the model display and texture application
tracking/ :tracking of body movements
metadata/ :data cleaning and loading
mainapp.py :main application
path.py: for local paths

# Smart Mirror

A smart mirror essentially consists of what is known as a police mirror, a small computer with WiFi and a display, and a frame.

## Hardware
To assemble your smart mirror, you will need:  
#### Computer
  * This could be a Raspberry Pi Modell 4B or a diffrent mini computer. 
#### Display
  * Choose an HD-Display in the size you want and you´ll need a display controller  
  * alternativley you can also take an old HD TV  
#### Cables
  * HDMI cable
  * power adapter for your computer  
  * power adapter for your display/TV
